# CS350
embedded programming with C++
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving. 
The final project I did was a thermostat system using the launchpad. When you push a button on it it blinks lights until the desired temperature is reached.

What did you do particularly well?
I felt like I understood the idead of embedded programming very well.

Where could you improve?
My C++ skills could improve.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
I am adding the skill of using the hardware specs to use them to design and program a project.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
The use of GPIO and interrupts and timers will be quite useful.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I was able to make the timer work and the interrupt work in a function which makes it maintainable.
